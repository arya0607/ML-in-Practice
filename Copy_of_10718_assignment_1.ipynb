        "\n",
        "The purpose of this exercise is to provide a quick introduction to the data and modeling problem we'll be using as an illustrative example throughout Machine Learning in Practice (10-718). Note that this colab notebook **only uses a small sample of the data**, but we'll be working with the full dataset as you get into your group projects for the rest of the semester.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Completing this assignment should only take you 2-3 hours.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Background\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook makes use of a sample of the data provided by [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) to the [2014 KDD Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data). Public schools in the United States face large disparities in funding, often resulting in teachers and staff members filling these gaps by purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets. DonorsChoose is an online crowdfunding platform that tries to help alleviate this financial burden on teachers by allowing them to seek funding for projects and resources from the community (projects can include classroom basics like books and markers, larger items like lab equipment or musical instruments, specific experiences like field trips or guest speakers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Projects on DonorsChoose expire after 4 months, and if the target funding level isn't reached, the project receives no funding. Since its launch in 2000, the platform has helped fund over 2 million projects at schools across the US, but about 1/3 of the projects that are posted nevertheless fail to meet their goal and go unfunded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Modeling Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this exercise, let's assume that DonorsChoose has hired a digital content expert who will review projects and help teachers improve their postings and increase their chances of reaching their funding threshold. Because this individualized review is a labor-intensive process, the digital content expert has ** time to review and support only 10% of the projects posted to the platform on a given day**.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are a data scientist working with DonorsChoose, and your task is to help this content expert focus their limited resources on projects that most need the help. As such, you want to build a model to **identify projects that are least likely to be fully funded before they expire**  and pass them off to the digital content expert for review.\n"
